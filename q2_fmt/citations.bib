	abstract = {Fecal microbiota transplantation ({FMT}) has been successfully applied to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in humans, but a precise method to measure which bacterial strains stably engraft in recipients and evaluate their association with clinical outcomes is lacking. We assembled a collection of 1,000 different bacterial strains that were cultured from the fecal samples of 22 {FMT} donors and recipients. Using our strain collection combined with metagenomic sequencing data from the same samples, we developed a statistical approach named Strainer for the detection and tracking of bacterial strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We applied Strainer to evaluate a cohort of 13 {FMT} longitudinal clinical interventions and detected stable engraftment of 71\% of donor microbiota strains in recipients up to 5 years post-{FMT}. We found that 80\% of recipient gut bacterial strains pre-{FMT} were eliminated by {FMT} and that post-{FMT} the strains present persisted up to 5 years later, together with environmentally acquired strains. Quantification of donor bacterial strain engraftment in recipients independently explained (precision 100\%, recall 95\%) the clinical outcomes (relapse or success) after initial and repeat {FMT}. We report a compendium of bacterial species and strains that consistently engraft in recipients over time that could be used in defined live biotherapeutic products as an alternative to {FMT}. Our analytical framework and Strainer can be applied to systematically evaluate either {FMT} or defined live bacterial therapeutic studies by quantification of strain engraftment in recipients.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
